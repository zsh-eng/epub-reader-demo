/**
 * Holds the semantic state of one live review, plus the policies that read it.
 *
 * Every review consumer — terminal UI, session runtime, browser client — observes this
 * shape instead of keeping its own selection, filter, note, and expansion state. It
 * carries no renderer state: no rendered rows, no measured geometry, no framework
 * objects. Renderer-local concerns (measured line cursors, scroll offsets, pane sizes)
 * stay with the renderer that measures them.
 *
 * Policies that interpret a stored value rather than change it live beside the shape
 * they read, so "which notes are visible" or "where does a note hang" gets one named
 * answer instead of an inline conditional per consumer.
