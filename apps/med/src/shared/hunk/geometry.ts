/**
 * Diff geometry: the questions every review renderer asks about a hunk.
 *
 * Which lines does a hunk occupy, which line does a whole-hunk note hang from, how do a
 * hunk's line indices move when its content is re-based onto another array, and how is
 * full source text split into the lines an expanded gap fills. Each answer lives here
 * once, because a renderer that re-derives one silently disagrees with the state store
 * that validates against it (`docs/browser-review-seam-audit.md`, A3/A4/A6/A10).
 *
 * The inputs are structural rather than `ReviewFileV1`: a parsed diff hunk and a projected
 * `ReviewHunkV1` both satisfy them, so the terminal can call these primitives from its
 * render path without projecting a whole semantic document first.
