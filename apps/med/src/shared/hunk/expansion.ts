/**
 * Collapsed-gap addressing: which file lines an expandable gap covers.
 *
 * A gap is addressed by a stable id (`before:<hunkIndex>` / `trailing:<hunkIndex>`) and
 * resolves to one inclusive line range per side. Renderers draw those ranges, expansion
 * slices source text with them, and note validation accepts or rejects a line against
 * them — so all three must resolve the same address (`docs/browser-review-seam-audit.md`,
 * A1/A2/A5).
 *
 * The input is the parsed diff geometry rather than a projected `ReviewFileV1`, so the
 * terminal's row builder can resolve an address without projecting a document first;
 * `reviewGapSourceForFile` adapts a semantic file onto the same shape.
