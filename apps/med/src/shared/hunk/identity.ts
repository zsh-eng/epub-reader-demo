/**
 * Content-derived identity for reviewed files.
 *
 * A review consumer must be able to ask "is this the same file I was reading?" after a
 * reload, a re-filter, or a transport hop, and answer it without depending on array
 * positions or renderer object identity. Every identity here is a pure function of the
 * facts it names, so two processes projecting the same content agree.
 *
 * The digest is an identity hash, not an integrity check: it is platform-neutral
 * arithmetic rather than a crypto primitive, so the shared model stays importable from a
 * browser bundle without a hashing runtime. Wire-integrity digests belong beside the
 * transport that verifies bytes, not here.
