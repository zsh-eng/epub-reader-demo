# Spaced

## Workbench app

The canonical source is `apps/spaced2` in Workbench. Use the root Bun install;
there is no app-local lockfile or separate Git repository.

```sh
# From the Workbench root
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run dev:spaced2
# In a second terminal
bun run dev:spaced2-server
bun run test:spaced2
bun run build:spaced2
```

The UI uses port 5180 and the local API uses port 8791. App-local environment
files and Wrangler state stay in this directory and out of Git. Production
remains `https://spaced2.zsheng.app`; `bun run deploy:spaced2` is an explicit
production deployment. Moving this repository does not migrate production data.
Read [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) and the
[migration notes](../../docs/SPACED_MIGRATION.md).
