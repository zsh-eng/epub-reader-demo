/**
 * Where a note hangs: one owner hunk plus every hunk it genuinely intersects.
 *
 * Placement and membership are different questions and are answered here together, once.
 * Ownership is recorded on the anchor rather than re-derived by containment, so a note
 * this resolver placed through its fallback is not silently dropped by a consumer that
 * re-derives placement (`docs/browser-review-seam-audit.md`, D3/B8).
 *
 * Resolution is permissive: an imported note may name a line the current patch no longer
 * shows, and losing it entirely would be worse than hanging it from the nearest real hunk.
 * Callers that must reject an unbacked target validate before anchoring rather than
 * reading a verdict out of the anchor.
