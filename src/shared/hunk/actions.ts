/**
 * Declares the actions the reducer executes: decided state transitions only.
 *
 * An action states what changes, not whether it should: lifecycle code and intent plans
 * decide that first. `reduceReviewState` applies one without further validation beyond
 * keeping the state internally consistent, so anything requiring judgement — "save the
 * current draft", "clear these notes" — is planned in `intents.ts` and lowered to these.
