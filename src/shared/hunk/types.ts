/**
 * Declares the value shapes every review consumer shares: files addressed by a stable
 * content-derived key rather than by renderer identity, hunks described as explicit
 * JSON-safe records rather than as a renderer's parsed metadata, and notes anchored to
 * line ranges rather than to rendered rows. Says nothing about how a review is drawn or
 * transported.
 *
 * The document carries what every consumer reads. Publication addresses — generations,
 * resource descriptors, digests — belong to the producer runtime and are absent here, so
 * nothing in this file implies a transport.
